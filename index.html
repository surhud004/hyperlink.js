        <h4>The world is full of emojis -</h4>
        <p>
            Look around! Technology is everywhere around you and in this fast-pacing world, if you are not <a href="https://medium.com/@lucaswetten/the-top-15-best-gadgets-of-the-decade-that-made-our-tech-hearts-melt-2bc454219f74" target="_blank">tech-ready</a>, you are out of this rat-race. It's all about texting, snapchatting, and a whole lot of different types of chatting. But, how do we express our emotions in messages? Enter Emojis. Emojis existed in messaging since email was invented. It's just that their UI has been updated. They went from :) to &#128578;. And, in a society where textual communication is used casually and more frequently than face-to-face conversation, conveying emotion is as important as it is when speaking to someone in person.
            Recently, Google announced their <a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1222973370012069888" target="_blank">new set of emojis</a> coming to the Android keyboard update. (Did you just see Google's Twitter media without visiting the site? &#128526;)

        <h4>Will AI make the future better?</h4>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are the current trending buzz-words. This technology was there in the 1950s but came into practical existence a few years ago. If you watched the recent Google I/O on YouTube, you might have seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM" target="_blank">Google Duplex's</a> demo given by Sundar Pichai. Recently, I also saw this amazing video posted on Twitter by <a href="https://twitter.com/mvollmer1/status/1222903876749152260" target="_blank">Dr. Marcell Vollmer</a> in which AI reads the car data and interprets in real-time. It is amazing to see how AI can blend-in with the real world. However, it might have some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA3VSIq3a2I" target="_blank">dangerous concerns</a> in the near future. I also tried to design a <a href="https://twitter.com/surhud004/status/1177697932545609728" target="_blank">case scenario on the Moral Machine</a> by MIT. Well, it didn't work as expected.
